## Write what you did here, and anything to note for long term work:

1. 12/2: Dahlia - created changes.md, added a temp logo and a temp title, cleaned up file structure, started working on css, added datacontext and mode context, fixed a few broken things, broke a few fine things (see layout and tooltip for most skipped)
  *Notes*
     - we need to run `npm run dev` from the **inyourhead** folder, and should honestly open VS code straight into the inyourhead folder bc titletbd is a useless layer
     - you can preview the md file with a plugin, i'm using "Markdown Preview Enhanced"
     - unless it's component-specific, keep css to global (or index or app if those are your preference)
     - for create color scheme u feed it the data for the domain, the mode, and if it's categorical which i accidentally named constant or ranked.
     - good luck
2. 12/4 Tate - Created treemap, attempted to fix tooltips (and failed)
             - Made Boring Stats (all bar charts for now, can be changed rather easily)
                 -put into a seperate folder for my ease
             - Made Title Keyword Chart (lollipop for now, variety and such)
             - Still have not fixed tooltips unfortunately, trying to avoid asking the robots for help
             - would like to try and style the site more but unsure where to start 
3. 12/7 Dahlia - added a shitload of server stuff, broke some things, fixed some things
4. 12/8 Dahlia - separated shit into pages, broke some things, fixed some things.
